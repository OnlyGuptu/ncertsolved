<br> (iii) Explain why water does not gather in the hollowed portions of

The water accumulates by means of osmosis. When sugar or salt is added in the cup, the concentration of this region becomes greater than the concentration of the normal water in the trough. The water accumulates naturally through the living potato cell membranes in order to reduce the concentration of sugar and salt.

(ii) Why is potato A used in this investigation?

Potato A is needed for control purposes. This is because it shows that water does not accumulate in the hollowed potato itself but a solute like sugar or salt is required.

(iii) Why doesn’t water accumulate in the hollowed part of A and D?

For potato A: No sugar or salt is added inside the hollowed part of this potato. Hence, there is no concentration gradient to accumulate water.

For potato D: The boiling process destroys the cells and thus the membranes are destroyed. Thus, osmosis cannot take place due to lack of living selectively permeable membranes.`, image: "images/aloo.png" },

However, she could sell only one-fourth of the produce in the local market. Recognising that a significant amount of produce may be lost post-harvest, she employed a traditional yet scientifically sound method to extend the shelf life of amla and lemons. She turned perishable produce into profitable products, such as pickles and sharbat. She used the excess produce to prepare pickles, murabbas, and sharbat by adding appropriate amounts of salt, sugar, or jaggery to small pieces of fruit and their juices. These were then stored in small glass bottles for sale, helping her prevent the wastage of post-harvest produce.

    a: "<b>(i) Immediate Impact:</b><br>The bark of a tree consists of cork cells (which are dead cells) that create the outermost protective layer. Once the bark is stripped away, the tree forfeits its primary layer of defense. The tree is subject to mechanical harm, assaults from pathogens and parasites, excessive moisture loss from the trunk, and harm from severe temperatures. The protective role of the dermal tissue system is entirely diminished.<br><br><b>(ii) Tissues Involved & Affected:</b><br>The lateral meristem (cork cambium) and phloem are positioned just below the bark. If the trunk sustains more damage, the phloem tissue will be impacted. Phloem transports nutrients from the leaves to the roots and various other sections of the plant. Injury to the phloem would halt the food supply, causing the roots and lower sections of the plant to starve and ultimately perish.<br><br><b>(iii) Long-term Effect on Growth:</b><br>If the tissues under the bark (primarily phloem and the lateral meristem) are harmed, the movement of nutrients from the leaves to the other parts of the plant would cease. The lateral meristem would be harmed, indicating the tree could no longer increase in diameter. Eventually, the tree would become weaker, cease growth, and might die as the roots would be deprived of their nutrients.<br><br><b>(iv) Key Assumptions:</b><br>We are presuming that the debarking is finished completely around the trunk (referred to as ring barking) and that it penetrates sufficiently to harm the phloem. We are also presuming that the xylem remains undamaged. If only a section of the bark was removed (not entirely around the trunk), some phloem would still be present, allowing the tree to potentially survive. If the xylem sustains damage as well, water transport would cease, leading to a quicker death of the tree. The extent and seriousness of the damage would greatly alter the result."

        a: "<b>Tissue Responsible:</b><br>The <b>sclerenchyma tissue</b> gives coconut husk fibers their toughness. Sclerenchyma cells are non-living (dead) at maturity, closely packed with no intercellular spaces, and have extremely thick walls due to uniform lignin deposition, making them highly resilient and fibrous.<br><br><b>Why Parenchyma is Unsuitable:</b><br>Living parenchyma cells have thin primary cell walls, loose packing with intercellular spaces, and active living cellular contents. They are soft, flexible, and adapted for storage or photosynthesis rather than mechanical support. If parenchyma were used, the fibers would lack tensile strength, be soft, and disintegrate rapidly under stress."

constant. Is it possible for her scooter to be accelerating and if so, how? `,
            a: `Yes, it is possible for the scooter to accelerate even if the speedometer reading is constant.This happens because velocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude (speed) and direction. Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity. If either the speed or the direction changes, acceleration occurs.If the girl rides her scooter at a constant speed along a curved path or a circular track, her direction of motion changes continuously at every point. Since her direction is changing, her velocity is changing, which means the scooter is accelerating (known as centripetal acceleration).

{q: `Why is distillation an effective method for separating a mixture of

        <h4>Which of the mixtures can be separated by Simple Distillation?</h4>
        <p>Out of the options provided in the question, the mixtures that can be separated using this setup are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>(a) water &ndash; acetone:</strong> This works perfectly because water boils at 100&deg;C and acetone at 56&deg;C. Their boiling point difference is 44&deg;C, which easily clears the minimum 25&deg;C gap needed for simple distillation.</li>
            <li><strong>(b) water &ndash; salt:</strong> This is a standard liquid-solid solution where only the water vaporises, leaving the non-volatile solid salt completely behind in the flask.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Note:</em> Mixtures like (c) acetone-alcohol, (e) alcohol-chloroform, and (f) alcohol-benzene have boiling points that are too close together (less than a 25&deg;C difference), so they would require fractional distillation instead.</p>

        The frictional force exerted by the floor is exactly equal to <strong>F</strong>, acting in the opposite direction.

Meanwhile, the 5 mistaken rowers are fighting them with 1,000 N of backward force (5 &times; 200 N). Subtracting the mistake gives a net forward push of 18,000 N.

        The landing mat is there to <strong>increase the time</strong> it takes for the athlete to come to a complete stop. Sinking into a soft cushion slows down the deceleration process.

        <li style="margin-top: 5px; list-style-type: none; margin-left: -20px;"><em>Explanation:</em> Self-pollination means the plant keeps fertilizing itself.

    <p style="margin: 0; color: #333; font-weight: bold;">12. In the lower Himalayan region of northern India, apples are an important cash crop that contribute significantly to farmer's livelihoods. The fruit yield in apple cultivation is declining continuously, associated with climate change and a significant decline in the population of natural pollinators. A researcher-farmer group set up two experimental apple orchards at two distinct locations: Places A and B. In apple orchards at Place A, they allowed natural pollinators to pollinate the flowers of the apple. In apple orchards at Place B, they applied mixed farming techniques of beekeeping. Along with honey, the farmer yielded apples. The yield of apples is depicted in Fig. 11.24, in terms of fruit setting (number of fruits/the total number of corresponding fruit-bearing branches) and fruit drop (premature falling of developing fruits) in the two types of experimental places of apple orchards.<br>
    (i) What are the hypotheses the researcher-farmers group has thought of for this investigation?<br>
    (ii) What are the different parameters in the experiment?<br>
    (iii) Compare and analyse the data of two experimental orchards Places A and B, in terms of high yields of apple fruits.<br>
    (iv) Based on your analysis, what do you infer from the data?</p>

Instead of naming organisms directly, scientists recorded only structural, cellular and nutritional features as given in the table below.<br><br>
    Based on the case study, answer the following questions —<br>
    (i) Identify one organism that clearly belongs to the Kingdom Fungi. State one observation that supports your answer.<br>
    (ii) Which organism would be placed in the Kingdom Monera? Mention one characteristic that justifies this placement.<br>
    (iii) Organisms R and Q are both eukaryotic, yet they are placed in different kingdoms. Analyse the criteria that separate them.<br>
    (iv) Explain why organism S cannot be classified using the mode of nutrition alone.<br>
    (v) Organism T does not fit into any of the five kingdoms. Which fundamental characteristic used in classification does it lack and what does this reveal about the limitations of classification systems?<br>
    (vi) If classification were based only on habitat, which organisms might be incorrectly grouped together? Explain the scientific consequences of such a classification.<br>
    (vii) Imagine scientists discover a new organism that is multicellular, eukaryotic, lacks chlorophyll and absorbs nutrients from a host externally. Should it be placed under fungi or animalia? Justify your reasoning using classification criteria.</p>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>High Albedo Impact:</strong> Light-colored surfaces like snow (0.80–0.90) and ice bounce most sunlight back, keeping polar areas cold. However, when global warming melts this ice, it reveals dark ocean water below.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Low Albedo Impact:</strong> Dark surfaces like open oceans or black soils have low albedo values.

        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Formation Process:</strong> During the day, mountain slopes heat up quickly under sunlight, causing the air over them to rise and drawing cooler air up from the valley floor as a **valley breeze**. At night, the slopes radiate heat away rapidly, making the air cold and dense so it sinks down into the valley as a **mountain breeze**.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Breeze Variation:</strong> Yes, the mountain breeze coming off the barren rock mountain will be noticeably different than the one from the grass-covered mountain.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Thermal Contrast:</strong> Barren rock has a low albedo and high thermal mass, meaning it absorbs a massive amount of solar energy during the day and re-radiates it intensely at night. Grass surfaces stay significantly cooler due to vegetation shade and moisture loss from plant transpiration. As a result, the nighttime breeze moving down the barren rock mountain will start warmer and transfer more re-radiated heat down into the valley floor.</li>

        <li style="margin-top: 5px; list-style-type: none; margin-left: -20px;"><em>Scientific Consequences:</em> This uniform angle would distribute solar energy evenly across the planet, erasing the natural temperature drop we see from the warm equator to the freezing poles. Without these heating differences, the planet would lose the pressure systems that drive global winds, planetary planetary wind belts, and ocean currents, flattening out global weather systems entirely.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Cryosphere Link:</strong> Warmer air temperatures accelerate the melting of mountain glaciers, ice sheets, and polar sea cover, rapidly shrinking the planet's ice reserves.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Hydrosphere Link:</strong> This melting ice dumps vast amounts of freshwater into the oceans, which changes water salinity and drives up global sea levels. Warmer ocean waters also evaporate faster, overloading the atmosphere with moisture and intensifying storms.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Biosphere Link:</strong> Rapidly changing habitats force land and marine species to adapt or face decline, disrupting fragile food webs.

        <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Illustrative Example:</strong> Consider how winter snowfall in the mountains connects these spheres. A drop in winter snow (**cryosphere**) reduces the volume of freshwater feeding mountain lakes and streams during the summer (**hydrosphere**). This water shortage leaves less moisture in the surrounding soil (**geosphere**), which stunts grass growth and reduces food food available for grazing herds (**biosphere**).

        1. It starts with a passion for a particular interest, then comes the conviction that it is imperative to realise it. Count the cost in years of effort, financial investments and sacrifice. Then if it is still burning in your blood and you are ready to commit yourself to the task, plunge. It could be in any field—sports, science, arts, business, or design. The road may be uphill most of the way and often you are buoyed up only by the knowledge that you are doing what you love best and are doing the right thing. When stamina is running out, the prospect of success will keep you on track.

    <li><strong>Core Heat Source:</strong> The movements driven by the Earth's internal forces are powered by intense heat originating from the planet's core.</li>
    <li><strong>Convection Mechanism:</strong> This extreme heat warms the molten material within the mantle, creating massive, continuous convection currents where hot material rises and cooler material sinks. These strong thermal currents act as a subterranean engine that pushes and pulls the tectonic plates, causing the outer crust to shift.</li>

                            a: `<ul>
    <li><strong>Mountain Building:</strong> Internal or endogenic forces operating within the Earth—specifically plate movements like folding and faulting—are directly responsible for creating major macro-landforms such as mountains, plains, and valleys.</li>
    <li><strong>Tectonic Collisions:</strong> For instance, when two massive continental landmasses move toward each other at a convergent boundary, the immense pressure buckles the crust. This specific endogenic force drives the formation of majestic fold mountain ranges, a prime example being the Himalaya.</li>

                            a: `<ul>
    <li><strong>Geographic Distribution:</strong> Earthquakes occur frequently along plate boundaries—the edges where tectonic plates meet and slide past, pull apart, or crash into one another. A vast majority of these seismic events take place around the Pacific Ocean in a highly active region famously known as the Ring of Fire.</li>
    <li><strong>Predictability Limitations:</strong> While modern geologists study plate maps to pinpoint high-risk zones and help cities manage potential disasters, exactly predicting their timing remains incredibly difficult. Historically, scholars like Varāhamihira attempted to track environmental clues like animal behaviour, clouds, and wind changes to signal them, reflecting an early attempt to blend observation with cosmological reasoning.</li>

                            a: `<ul>
    <li><strong>Boundary Dynamics:</strong> Tectonic plates are in a state of slow, constant motion driven by mantle convection. The intense friction, pressure, and structural cracking that happen where these massive slabs of solid rock interact create the perfect conditions for geological instability.</li>
    <li><strong>Seismic Realities:</strong> When plates pull apart at divergent boundaries, magma forces its way up to create new crust, and when plates collide at convergent boundaries, tectonic activity triggers severe volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Because these violent releases of sub-crustal energy are concentrated right along the margins where plates grind together, most of the world's volcanoes and earthquakes align perfectly with plate borders.</li>

    <li><strong>Meander and Delta Features:</strong> A meander is a winding curve or loop formed in the middle or lower course of a river due to lateral erosion on outer banks and sediment deposition on inner banks. A delta is a fan-shaped or triangular landform created at a river's mouth where it slows down, enters a sea or lake, and deposits its remaining load.</li>

                            a: `<ul>
    <li><strong>Loss of Soil Anchor:</strong> Deforestation severely accelerates surface erosion by removing the vital root networks that naturally anchor the soil together. Without this protective root system and vegetation cover, the raw land is left completely exposed and vulnerable.</li>
    <li><strong>Environmental Domino Effect:</strong> Once the vegetation is stripped away, natural forces like heavy rainfall and strong winds can easily wear down and sweep the fertile topsoil away. This lack of root stability on hillsides and slopes noticeably increases the risk of sudden natural disasters like landslides.</li>

    <li><strong>Afforestation and Vegetative Cover:</strong> Plant native trees, shrubs, and grasses along exposed soil surfaces, roadsides, and riverbanks to establish root networks that bind soil particles and curb water runoff.</li>
    <li><strong>Terracing and Bunding on Slopes:</strong> Implement step-terracing and earthen embankments along natural contour lines on elevated ground to slow down surface runoff velocity and enhance groundwater absorption.</li>

    <li><strong>1. Sacred Mountain Summits (Himalayan Fold Mountains - Mt. Kailash & Nanda Devi):</strong> Revered across Himalayan folklore as the celestial axis and the cosmic abode of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. Local folklore tells that the snow-clad peaks stand as divine guardians safeguarding the northern plains from freezing winds. Indigenous communities perform circumambulations (Parikrama) and consider scaling these summits forbidden, a tradition that historically protected fragile high-altitude alpine ecology from human encroachment.</li>
    <li><strong>2. Holy River Confluence (Sangam at Prayagraj - Fluvial River Plains):</strong> In folklore and epic tradition, this is the sacred meeting point where the Ganga, Yamuna, and mythical subterranean Saraswati converge. According to the <em>Samudra Manthan</em> folk legend, celestial drops of the nectar of immortality (<em>Amrita</em>) spilled into the river here. The visibly contrasting shades—the deep emerald of the Yamuna and the silt-laden ochre of the Ganga—symbolize the harmony of natural elements, inspiring annual gatherings like the Magh and Kumbh Mela centered on river purification.</li>
    <li><strong>3. Sacred Limestone Caverns (Karst Cave Formations - Amarnath & Gupteshwar Caves):</strong> Formed deep within carbonate rock by the persistent action of underground water dissolving and redepositing calcium carbonate into stalactites and stalagmites. In regional folklore, Lord Shiva chose this secluded cave to narrate the secret of creation and immortality (<em>Amar Katha</em>) to Goddess Parvati, where ice stalagmites form natural sacred icons each year. These legends fostered deep respect for subterranean aquifers and sacred springs among local communities.</li>
    <li><strong>4. Community Conservation Value:</strong> Connecting sacred folklore with distinctive geological landforms is one of the world's oldest forms of community-led environmental stewardship, safeguarding mountains, riverbanks, and forests through cultural reverence.</li>

    <li><strong>Methods for Broad Control:</strong> Monarchs distributed territorial supervision across provinces and districts, posted regional governors (<em>pradeśhikas</em>), collaborated with town guild dignitaries, and maintained transit corridors.</li>

  <p>3. After studying this chapter, what do you think were the most important features of the state and society in India before 1000 CE?</p>
</div>`,
    a: `<div class="a-block">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ethical Frameworks:</strong> Sovereignty and daily living were shaped by philosophical notions of righteousness (<em>dharma</em>), cosmic order (<em>rita</em>), and spiritual equality (<em>samatva</em>).</li>
    <li><strong>Self-Sustaining Local Councils:</strong> Grassroots administration functioned through autonomous village committees and professional merchant associations (<em>shreṇīs</em>) that settled disputes, managed public property, and funded civic needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Vibrant Cultural Intercourse:</strong> The civilization supported wide-ranging overland and oceanic commerce (<em>Uttarāpatha</em>, <em>Dakshiṇāpatha</em>), residential centers of higher learning, and evolving social customs.</li>

</div>`,
    a: `<div class="a-block">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rigveda:</strong> Documents an early kinship-driven community featuring collective assemblies (<em>sabhā</em>, <em>samiti</em>, <em>vidhata</em>) and flexible trade pursuits within single households.</li>
    <li><strong>Arthashastra:</strong> Sets forth a structured doctrine of pragmatic administration focused on the seven pillars of polity (<em>Saptāṃga</em>), state revenue monitoring, and economic enterprise.</li>
    <li><strong>Mahābhārata:</strong> In the <em>Shanti Parva</em>, it explores the ruler’s ethical burden to guard society, dispense impartial justice, and sustain collective social wellbeing.</li>

  <p>5. What can we learn from early Indian society about varna and the role of women?</p>
</div>`,
    a: `<div class="a-block">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Varna Arrangement:</strong> Initial classifications were functional divisions of duties rather than inherited identities at birth, permitting mobility across occupational roles.</li>
    <li><strong>Standing of Women:</strong> In early periods, women accessed education, composed sacred hymns (such as Lopamudra and Ghoshā), and took part in public congregations. Even with later cultural constraints, royal women like Prabhāvatī Gupta exercised political regency, and southern records celebrate female bards, traders, and cultural donors.</li>

  <p>6. Explain how assemblies like sabhā and samiti limited the power of the rājā. Which modern institutions perform similar functions today?</p>
</div>`,
    a: `<div class="a-block">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Checks on Chieftain Authority:</strong> The <em>sabhā</em> served as an elder council handling legal verdicts, while the <em>samiti</em> served as a popular gathering for collective political decision-making, restraining unilateral ruler actions.</li>
    <li><strong>Contemporary Parallels:</strong> Modern parliamentary chambers and constitutional supreme courts operate with comparable oversight to keep executive heads of state accountable.</li>

</div>`,
    a: `<div class="a-block">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Distinction:</strong> <em>Varṇa</em> designated the overarching four-part functional template (Brāhmaṇa, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shūdra), whereas <em>jāti</em> represented numerous regional, endogamous communities centered on trades.</li>
    <li><strong>Factors of Formation:</strong> Proliferation occurred due to cross-community family unions, the conversion of trade guilds into localized social networks, migratory influxes, and the incorporation of forest societies into agricultural regions.</li>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose of Integrated Learning:</strong> Classical instruction nurtured technical expertise alongside ethical virtues—self-restraint, respect, and duty—to prepare students for responsible community life.</li>
    <li><strong>Societal Benefit:</strong> Grounding students in civic duty ensured administrators, scholars, and merchants performed their trades with honesty, reinforcing social harmony and institutional stability.</li>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Commercial Integration:</strong> The northern <em>Uttarāpatha</em> and southern <em>Dakshiṇāpatha</em> channels connected inland trading towns with coastal ports, facilitating traffic in textiles, spices, metals, and gemstones[cite: 85, 86, 87].</li>
    <li><strong>Cultural and Intellectual Exchange:</strong> These highways enabled traveling monks, craftspeople, and academics to share architectural methods, philosophical ideas, and literary traditions across different regions[cite: 81, 87, 88].</li>

    <li><strong>Elite Theoretical Lens:</strong> Works like the <em>Arthashastra</em> or royal edicts depict prescribed ideals rather than day-to-day realities experienced by ordinary subjects.</li>
    <li><strong>Absence of Subaltern Voices:</strong> Court texts minimize perspectives from marginal groups, agricultural laborers, and lower artisanal strata, making corroboration with archaeology, copper-plate records, and folk accounts necessary.</li>
